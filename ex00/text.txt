(vector, list, deque, etc..)
-First parameter - A container of type T (std::vector<int>)
- Second parameter - A integer value to search for

- How to search through a generic container
- What do all standard containers have in common? Iterators

what to return 
- if i find the result should i return a iterator, a value, or the position 
-if not found - Throw an exception. Which type?
